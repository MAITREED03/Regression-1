    "Simple linear regression involves predicting the value of one dependent variable (usually denoted as y) based on the values of a single independent variable (usually denoted as x).\n",
    "The relationship between the two variables is assumed to be linear, meaning it can be represented by a straight line.\n",

    "Suppose you want to predict a student's final exam score (y) based on the number of hours they spent studying (x). You collect data and find that the relationship can be approximated by the equation y=5x+70. This means that for every additional hour a student studies, you expect their exam score to increase by 5 points, and the starting score (when x is 0) is 70.\n",

The multiple linear regression equation might be represented as y=500x1+300x2−100x3+5000. Here, the coefficients (500, 300, -100) represent the impact of each independent variable on the predicted house price, and 5000 is the y-intercept."

    "Linear regression relies on several assumptions to be valid. It's important to check these assumptions to ensure the reliability of the regression results. Here are the key assumptions of linear regression:\n",

    "Linearity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumption: The relationship between the independent and dependent variables is linear.\n",
    "Checking: Scatter plots of the dependent variable against each independent variable can help visually inspect linearity. If the relationship appears to be roughly linear, this assumption may hold.\n",
    "Independence of Errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumption: The residuals (the differences between actual and predicted values) should be independent. One observation's error should not predict the error of another observation.\n",
    "Checking: Plotting the residuals against the predicted values can help identify patterns or trends. If there is no clear structure in the plot, independence might be reasonable.\n",
    "Homoscedasticity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumption: The variance of the residuals should be constant across all levels of the independent variables.\n",
    "Checking: Plotting residuals against predicted values helps to identify whether the spread of residuals remains roughly constant across the range of predictions. A funnel shape in the plot may indicate heteroscedasticity.\n",
    "Normality of Residuals:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumption: The residuals should be normally distributed.\n",
    "Checking: Histograms or Q-Q plots of the residuals can be examined. If the residuals deviate significantly from a normal distribution, transformations or alternative models might be considered.\n",
    "No Perfect Multicollinearity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumption: Independent variables should not be perfectly correlated with each other.\n",
    "Checking: Correlation matrices or variance inflation factors (VIF) can be used to assess multicollinearity. High correlations or VIF values suggest potential multicollinearity issues.\n",
    "No Endogeneity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumption: The independent variables are not correlated with the error term.\n",
    "Checking: This assumption is often challenging to test directly. Theoretical reasoning and domain knowledge play a crucial role in assessing potential endogeneity issues.\n",
    "Additivity:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Descent:\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient descent is an iterative optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost or loss function in machine learning models. The goal is to find the optimal parameters of a model that minimize the difference between predicted and actual outcomes. In the context of linear regression, for example, gradient descent helps find the optimal values for the slope and intercept that result in the best-fitting line.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea behind gradient descent is to update the model parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient of the cost function with respect to those parameters. This process continues iteratively until the algorithm converges to a minimum, ideally the global minimum. The gradient represents the direction of the steepest ascent, and moving in the opposite direction allows the algorithm to descend towards the minimum.\n",

    "Calculate the gradient of the cost function with respect to each parameter. The gradient provides the direction and magnitude of the steepest ascent.\n",

    "Repeat:\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence or a predefined number of iterations.\n",
    "Learning Rate:\n",
    "The learning rate is a crucial hyperparameter in gradient descent. It determines the size of the steps taken during each iteration. A too-small learning rate may result in slow convergence, while a too-large learning rate can lead to overshooting the minimum or oscillations around it.\n",

    "Batch Gradient Descent:\n",
    "\n",
    "Computes the gradient of the entire training dataset at each iteration.\n",
    "Suitable for small to moderately sized datasets.\n",
    "Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):\n",
